# 001.0-DEV-RUN-NPM-OUTDATED: Run npm outdated

## Release Goal

**Release 0.1: Foundation**

Start with what works - leverage `npm outdated` to identify packages that have updates available. This is the simplest possible starting point.

## How This Story Contributes

Don't reinvent the wheel. `npm outdated` already does the hard work of comparing current versions to latest. We'll build on top of it rather than reimplementing it.

## User Story

**Format**: So that I can see which packages have updates available, as a developer, I want dry-aged-deps to run `npm outdated` and show me the results.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: No dependencies on other stories; this is the foundation
- **Negotiable**: Display format and filtering options can be refined
- **Valuable**: Provides immediate visibility into project dependencies
- **Estimable**: Clear scope - read JSON file and display contents
- **Small**: Can be completed in a single iteration
- **Testable**: Clear success criteria with verifiable output

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Core Functionality**: Runs `npm outdated --json` in the current directory
- [ ] **Parse Output**: Parses the JSON output from npm outdated
- [ ] **Display Results**: Shows the outdated packages
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Handles when npm outdated fails
- [ ] **No Updates**: Handles when no packages are outdated

## Requirements (Current Implementation or To Be Implemented)

- **REQ-NPM-COMMAND**: Execute `npm outdated --json` using child_process
- **REQ-JSON-PARSE**: Parse the JSON output
- **REQ-OUTPUT-DISPLAY**: Display results in readable format

## Dependencies

None - this is the foundation story.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing (edge cases covered)
- [ ] Integration test with real package.json files
- [ ] Error handling tested for all failure scenarios
- [ ] Documentation includes usage examples
- [ ] CLI help text explains the command

## Story Notes

**Gall's Law Compliance**: Start with what already works - `npm outdated`. Don't reimplement what npm already does well.

**Next Evolution**: Story 002.0 will fetch version ages for the outdated packages.
