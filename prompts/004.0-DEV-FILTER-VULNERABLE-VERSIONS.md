# 004.0-DEV-FILTER-VULNERABLE-VERSIONS: Filter Out Vulnerable Versions

## Release Goal

**Release 0.3: Security Intelligence**

Check the filtered mature versions for vulnerabilities and eliminate vulnerable ones. Smart checking: start from the newest mature version and work backwards until finding a safe one.

## How This Story Contributes

Completes the smart filtering by adding security to maturity. Now we recommend the newest mature version that has no known vulnerabilities.

## User Story

**Format**: So that I only update to safe, non-vulnerable versions, as a developer, I want dry-aged-deps to check mature versions for security vulnerabilities and filter out vulnerable ones.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: Builds on mature version filtering
- **Negotiable**: Vulnerability severity threshold could be configurable
- **Valuable**: Ensures security alongside maturity
- **Estimable**: Clear scope - check and filter
- **Small**: Single iteration
- **Testable**: Can verify vulnerability filtering

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Core Functionality**: Checks mature versions for known vulnerabilities (direct and transitive dependencies)
- [ ] **Transitive Dependencies**: Detects vulnerabilities in the entire dependency tree, not just the direct package
- [ ] **Smart Checking**: Checks newest mature first, works backwards until finding safe version
- [ ] **Eliminate Vulnerable**: Removes versions with known vulnerabilities from recommendations
- [ ] **Final Output**: Shows npm outdated style output with safe, mature updates only
- [ ] **No Safe Version**: Clearly indicates when no safe mature version exists

## Requirements (Current Implementation or To Be Implemented)

- **REQ-AUDIT-CHECK**: Use `npm audit` or registry API to check for vulnerabilities
- **REQ-TRANSITIVE-DEPS**: Check the entire dependency tree (direct and transitive dependencies) for vulnerabilities
- **REQ-SMART-SEARCH**: Check newest mature version first, work backwards
- **REQ-SAFE-ONLY**: Only recommend versions with no known vulnerabilities in the entire dependency chain
- **REQ-CLEAR-OUTPUT**: Show final filtered results in npm outdated format

## Dependencies

- **003.0-DEV-FILTER-MATURE-VERSIONS**: Need mature versions to check

## Story Notes

**Gall's Law Compliance**: Adds final security filter to the working mature version filter.

**MVP Complete**: With stories 001-004, we have a complete safe updater that shows npm outdated style output filtered for maturity AND security.

**Transitive Dependency Example**: The vulnerability in `@semantic-release/npm@13.1.1` (via `tar@7.5.1`) demonstrates why checking the entire dependency tree is critical. A package may appear safe directly but contain vulnerable transitive dependencies.
