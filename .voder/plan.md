## NOW
Populate `CHANGELOG.md` by filling in the release date for version 0.1.0 and summarizing all implemented features (npm-outdated wrapper, version-time fetching, age calculation, CLI output).

## NEXT
- Extend `README.md` with a “Usage & Examples” section that demonstrates the CLI command, flags, and sample table output.  
- Create `docs/api.md` to document the public functions (`fetchVersionTimes`, `calculateAgeInDays`) and their inputs/outputs.  
- Add `docs/architecture.md` to describe the module layout and key design decisions.

## LATER
- Integrate JSDoc (or TypeDoc) generation into CI to publish API docs automatically.  
- Stand up a static documentation site (e.g. Docusaurus or GitHub Pages) for user and developer guides.  
- Author and package a man page for `dry-aged-deps` and include it in the distribution.
