## NOW
Stage and commit all outstanding local changes with a clear descriptive message to restore a clean Git working directory.

## NEXT
- Create and push a new `develop` branch off `main`.  
- Tag the current `main` commit as `v0.1.0` and push that tag to origin.  
- Document the branching and release workflow in a CONTRIBUTING.md or docs/branching.md file.

## LATER
- Integrate semantic-release or changesets for fully automated version bumping and Git tagging.  
- Add Husky pre-commit/pre-push hooks to enforce commit message conventions and run lint/tests.  
- Adopt a formal branching model (e.g., GitFlow or trunk-based) and update team guidelines accordingly.
