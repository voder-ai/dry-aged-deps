  <evidence>• bin/dry-aged-deps.js: help text still shows “--config-file=<file> … (coming soon)” and no code reading .dry-aged-deps.json
• No code in src/ or bin/ that imports or parses a configuration file
• README.md note “configuration-file support (.dry-aged-deps.json) are coming soon and not yet implemented” remains unchanged
• No .dry-aged-deps.json example file in repo
• No tests referencing config file parsing, merging, precedence, validation, or error handling</evidence>
  <notes>The specification for config file support exists, but there is no implementation: the CLI does not read or merge config values, there are no tests, documentation is not updated beyond ‘coming soon’, and help text still marks it as unimplemented.</notes>
