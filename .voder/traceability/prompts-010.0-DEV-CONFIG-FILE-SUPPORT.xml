  <evidence>- src/config-loader.js implements loading, parsing, validation, and merging of `.dry-aged-deps.json` with CLI args
- src/cli-options.js reads config file (default `.dry-aged-deps.json`), merges with CLI flags (CLI > config > defaults)
- Tests in `test/cli.config-file.test.js` cover all required scenarios: default application, CLI override, invalid JSON, unknown keys, invalid values, custom config-file name, missing custom config file
- `npx vitest run` passes 145/145 tests, including all config-file related tests
- README.md contains documentation and example of the configuration file</evidence>
  <notes>All mandatory acceptance criteria for config file support have been implemented and verified: the tool looks for `.dry-aged-deps.json` in the project root, supports all schema fields (minAge, severity, prod/dev thresholds, format), validates inputs with clear error messages, allows CLI overrides, works without a config file, and is documented in the README. The optional JSON schema file was noted as recommended but not required.</notes>
