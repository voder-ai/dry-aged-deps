  <evidence>1) bin/dry-aged-deps.js contains a block under “Story: prompts/010.0-DEV-CONFIG-FILE-SUPPORT.md” that: reads .dry-aged-deps.json from CWD (REQ-CONFIG-LOCATION), parses JSON, validates top-level keys [minAge,severity,prod,dev,format], validates prod/dev sub-keys and ranges, merges config with built-in defaults, and applies CLI flags with precedence CLI > config > defaults (REQ-PRECEDENCE). 2) test/cli.config-file.test.js (89 total Vitest tests) covers: applying default config values, CLI-override behavior, invalid JSON exit code/message, unknown key exit code/message, invalid values, custom config-file name support, and missing custom config-file error. 3) README.md includes `--config-file` flag in options table and an example .dry-aged-deps.json snippet demonstrating all supported fields and usage. 4) No schema file was added (schema support was optional).</evidence>
  <notes>All mandatory acceptance criteria for config-file support are satisfied: the tool automatically reads and validates a JSON config in project root, merges it correctly with defaults, respects CLI overrides, handles errors cleanly, remains optional if absent, and is documented in README. The optional JSON-schema file was not added, but that was non-blocking.</notes>
