  <evidence>The file prompts/dry-aged-deps-user-story-map.md is a high-level user story map and planning document covering multiple iterations and stories (001.0 through 009), rather than a single, self-contained user story or specification with concrete acceptance criteria to verify.</evidence>
  <notes>This is a roadmap/story map, not an individual story spec, so it’s classified as NOT_SPEC.</notes>
