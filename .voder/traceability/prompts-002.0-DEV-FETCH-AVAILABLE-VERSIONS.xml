  <evidence>In src/fetch-version-times.js the npm view call always retrieves the full “time” mapping for all versions and src/print-outdated.js only ever looks up the publish date for info.latest, never iterating over or filtering versions newer than info.current. There is no code that limits the npm view call to versions > current nor any logic to calculate or display ages for each version beyond the latest. No test exercises “smart fetching” (only newer versions) or per-version age display.</evidence>
  <notes>While publish-time retrieval and single-version age calculation/display are implemented and well-tested, the key optimization and multi-version criteria from the story (“only fetch versions newer than current” and “display ages alongside each version”) are not present. The story’s acceptance criteria are therefore not fully met.</notes>
