  <evidence>In src/build-rows.js the implementation only computes the age for the single ‘latest’ version:

  const versionTimes = await fetchVersionTimes(name);
  const latestTime = versionTimes[info.latest];
  if (latestTime) {
    age = calculateAgeInDays(latestTime);
  }

There is no iteration over all versions newer than the current, nor any filtering to fetch only those versions. No tests cover fetching or displaying ages for multiple versions or the “smart fetching” optimization. The acceptance criteria (“fetch all versions and their publish dates”, “calculate age for each version”, “display ages alongside each version”, “only fetch newer versions”) are not met by this code.</evidence>
  <notes>The core fetchVersionTimes and calculateAgeInDays functions exist and work, but the downstream logic in buildRows and printOutdated only handles the latest version. There is no handling of multiple version ages nor a mechanism to optimize fetching to only newer versions. Consequently, the story is not fully implemented.</notes>
