  <evidence>The fetchVersionTimes implementation (src/fetch-version-times.js) always returns time data for every published version and is never passed a current‐version filter (no REQ-OPTIMIZATION). In printOutdated (src/print-outdated.js) we only ever look up and display the age of the single `info.latest` version—there is no loop over all versions newer than current, nor any code pruning versionTimes to those > current. No tests cover filtering to only newer versions or rendering ages for each available version.</evidence>
  <notes>The core fetch (npm view … time) and age calculation are implemented and tested, and the CLI prints a single age column. However, the story’s smart‐fetching optimization (only versions newer than the current) and displaying ages next to every newer version have not been implemented.</notes>
