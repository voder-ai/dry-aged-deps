  <evidence>The story’s optimization criterion (“Smart Fetching: Only fetch versions newer than current”) is not implemented. The fetchVersionTimes function in src/fetch-version-times.js always runs `npm view <package> time --json` (returning all version timestamps), and buildRows simply calls fetchVersionTimes(name) without passing a version filter or range. There is no code that limits the npm view call to versions newer than the current version.</evidence>
  <notes>While core functionality (fetching version times, calculating age, and displaying ages in rows) is fully covered by tests, the optimization requirement to fetch only newer versions has not been implemented, so not all acceptance criteria are satisfied.</notes>
