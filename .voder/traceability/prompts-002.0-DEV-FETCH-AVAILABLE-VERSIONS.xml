  <evidence>All existing tests (unit and end-to-end) for prompts/002.0-DEV-FETCH-AVAILABLE-VERSIONS.md pass, confirming that fetchVersionTimes, calculateAgeInDays, and the display of a single age column work correctly. However, there is no implementation (and no tests) for “Smart Fetching” (REQ-OPTIMIZATION): the code always calls `npm view <pkg> time --json` and then only reads the timestamp for `info.latest`, without filtering out versions older than the current version. No logic prunes or limits the fetched versions to only those newer than the installed version.</evidence>
  <notes>While core functionality, age calculation, and display are covered and tested, the optimization to fetch only versions newer than the current version (Acceptance Criterion #4) is missing. To fully satisfy the story, we need to implement and test REQ-OPTIMIZATION.</notes>
