  <evidence>The implementation of fetchVersionTimes in src/fetch-version-times.js always calls `npm view <pkg> time --json` to retrieve timestamps for all published versions, and buildRows then only uses the `latest` version’s timestamp. There is no logic that limits the npm view invocation or subsequent processing to versions newer than the package’s current version. Furthermore, there are no tests covering “smart fetching” (filtering to only fetch/check versions newer than current).</evidence>
  <notes>All other acceptance criteria (core fetching, age calculation, displaying age) are satisfied, but the optimization requirement to fetch only versions newer than the current version is not implemented.</notes>
