  <evidence>The implementation in src/fetch-version-times.js always fetches the complete set of version timestamps via `npm view <pkg> time --json` and returns all entries. In src/build-rows.js and print-outdated, there is no logic that filters or limits the fetched versions to only those newer than the current version. No code or tests reference REQ-OPTIMIZATION, and the ‘smart fetching’ acceptance criterion is never exercised.</evidence>
  <notes>Core fetching, age calculation, and display of ages are implemented and tested, but the requested optimization to fetch only newer versions is missing.</notes>
