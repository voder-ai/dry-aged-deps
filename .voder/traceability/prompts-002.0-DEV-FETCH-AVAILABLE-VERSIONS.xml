  <evidence>Implementation inspects version times via npm view and calculates age only for the “latest” version for each package, not for all versions newer than the current:

• fetch-version-times.js returns a map of all version→date but print-outdated.js only does:
    const latestTime = versionTimes[info.latest];
    age = calculateAgeInDays(latestTime);

• No code enumerates every version > current or prints their individual ages.
• No optimization to only fetch newer versions is implemented (npm view always returns all).
• Tests cover fetchVersionTimes parsing/retries and that the CLI prints an Age column for the latest version, but there are no tests for multiple-version ages or smart fetching.</evidence>
  <notes>The core plumbing (npm view, age calculation, CLI age column) is in place, but the story’s acceptance criteria to fetch, age–calculate, and display every version newer than current — and to optimize fetching only those versions — are not implemented or tested. Thus the story is incomplete.</notes>
