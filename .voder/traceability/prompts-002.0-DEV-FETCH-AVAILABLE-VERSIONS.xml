  <evidence>The implementation in src/fetch-version-times.js fetches all version times, and src/print-outdated.js only ever looks up the single 'latest' version’s publish date (info.latest). There is no logic to compare against info.current or to fetch/display ages for each version newer than current. No code filters or iterates over intermediate versions, and no tests cover 'Smart Fetching: Only fetch versions newer than current'.</evidence>
  <notes>Acceptance criteria for Core Functionality, Age Calculation, and Display Ages are met (fetchVersionTimes works, calculateAgeInDays is used, age shown for the latest version), but the Smart Fetching optimization—fetching or filtering only versions newer than the current version and displaying ages for each of those versions—is not implemented.</notes>
