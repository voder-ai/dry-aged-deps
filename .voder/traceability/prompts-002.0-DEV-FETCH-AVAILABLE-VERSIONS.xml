  <evidence>The implementation in src/fetch-version-times.js does fetch all version publish times (satisfying REQ-NPM-VIEW) and src/age-calculator.js correctly computes days since publish (REQ-AGE-CALC). However, in src/print-outdated.js the code only looks up and displays the age of the single `latest` version per package, rather than fetching and calculating ages for *all* versions newer than `current`. Moreover, there is no logic to optimize the npm view call to only retrieve versions newer than the current one (REQ-OPTIMIZATION is missing). There are no tests covering selective fetching or displaying ages for every newer version.</evidence>
  <notes>While core fetching and age calculation exist, the story’s Acceptance Criteria 1 (fetch & return all newer versions’ publish dates) and 4 (only fetch versions newer than current) are not implemented, and the UI only displays the age of the latest version rather than each newer version.</notes>
