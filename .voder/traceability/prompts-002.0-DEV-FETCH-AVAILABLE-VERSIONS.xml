  <evidence>• fetch-version-times.js always invokes `npm view <pkg> time --json` and returns all version–time entries, but there is no code that limits the fetch or subsequent processing to only versions newer than the current version (REQ-OPTIMIZATION).
• print-outdated.js only ever looks up and calculates an age for `info.latest`, never iterating over or displaying all versions newer than the current version as described in acceptance (“fetch publish dates for all versions newer than my current version” and “show age alongside each version”).
• No tests cover partial fetching or version‐range filtering; all existing tests assume only the latest version’s age is needed.

Tests run: `npm test` (Vitest 93/93 passing, 97.6% coverage)</evidence>
  <notes>While the code correctly fetches publish times, calculates age for the latest version, and displays that age, it does not implement the smart‐fetch optimization nor handle all newer versions as specified in the story. Therefore not all acceptance criteria are satisfied.</notes>
