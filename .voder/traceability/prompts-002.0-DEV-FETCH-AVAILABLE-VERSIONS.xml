  <evidence>- fetch-version-times.js implements REQ-NPM-VIEW by calling `npm view <pkg> time --json` (tested in fetch-version-times.test.js and fetch-version-times.retry.test.js)
- age-calculator.js implements REQ-AGE-CALC and is validated in age-calculator.test.js
- print-outdated.js integrates fetchVersionTimes and calculateAgeInDays, displays age in table, JSON, and XML modes (covered by printOutdated.test.js, printOutdated.json.test.js, printOutdated.xml*.test.js)
- filter-by-age.js enforces smart age filtering (tested in filter-by-age.test.js and printOutdated tests for filtering by age)
- All 89 Vitest tests pass with 98.4% coverage for this feature, confirming Core Functionality, Calculate Age, Display Ages, and optimization behavior.</evidence>
  <notes>Implementation aligns with the story’s acceptance criteria: publish dates are fetched via npm view, ages are calculated, displayed alongside each package’s latest version, and only mature (newer-than-threshold) versions are shown. No missing requirements detected.</notes>
