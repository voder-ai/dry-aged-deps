  <evidence>The implementation in src/fetch-version-times.js always runs “npm view <pkg> time --json” to retrieve all versions, and buildRows (src/build-rows.js) only uses the date for the single “latest” version to calculate and display age. There is no code that limits fetching or processing to only versions newer than the current installed version (REQ-OPTIMIZATION), nor is there logic to display the age for each available version—only the latest version’s age is shown. No tests cover selective fetching or per-version age display.</evidence>
  <notes>Core fetching of publish dates, age calculation, and display of the latest version’s age are implemented, but the required optimization to fetch only newer versions and the display of ages for all available versions are missing, so the story’s acceptance criteria are not fully met.</notes>
