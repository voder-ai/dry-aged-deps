  <evidence>The implementation in src/fetch-version-times.js correctly retrieves a mapping of all version publish times via “npm view <pkg> time --json”, and calculateAgeInDays computes days correctly. However, printOutdated (src/print-outdated.js) only looks up the publish time for info.latest and calculates a single age value per package. There is no code to iterate over all versions newer than the current version nor to filter fetches to only those versions. No tests exercise fetching or displaying ages for each newer version, nor cover a “smart fetching” optimization.</evidence>
  <notes>The story requires fetching publish dates and calculating ages for all versions newer than the current version, and optimizing to only fetch those versions. The current implementation only fetches all version times (without filtering) but then only uses the latest version’s date, and lacks any smart-fetching optimization. Acceptance criteria for core functionality beyond latest version and optimization are not met.</notes>
