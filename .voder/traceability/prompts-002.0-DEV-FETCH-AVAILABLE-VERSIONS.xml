  <evidence>The implementation does not honor the “Smart Fetching” acceptance criterion (REQ-OPTIMIZATION).  
• fetch-version-times.js always runs `npm view <pkg> time --json` (fetching all versions) with no semver-based filter.  
• build-rows.js blindly reads only the `latest` entry from the full time map—it never fetches or calculates ages for only those versions newer than the current.  
• There are no tests around limiting the fetch to versions > current, nor any code path that applies such an optimization.</evidence>
  <notes>Core fetch (REQ-NPM-VIEW), age calculation (REQ-AGE-CALC), and displaying the latest-version age are implemented and tested, but the required optimization to only fetch/check versions newer than the current version is missing.  To pass this story, add a version filter (semver compare > current) so that npm is only invoked for newer versions, and add corresponding tests.</notes>
