  <evidence>The implementation in src/fetch-version-times.js always runs `npm view <pkg> time --json` (fetching all version times) regardless of the current version, and buildRows only ever calculates age for the single `latest` version. There is no logic to limit fetching or checking to versions newer than the current version as specified by the SMART FETCHING acceptance criterion. No tests exist to verify that only newer versions are fetched.</evidence>
  <notes>While core functionality (fetching times, calculating age, displaying age) is correctly implemented and tested, the SMART FETCHING optimization—fetching only versions newer than the currently installed version—is not implemented, failing the story’s acceptance criteria.</notes>
