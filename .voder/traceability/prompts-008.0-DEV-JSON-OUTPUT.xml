  <evidence>In src/json-formatter.js the output schema only includes: timestamp, packages (with name,current,wanted,latest,age), summary (totalOutdated,safeUpdates,filteredByAge,filteredBySecurity,thresholds). It omits vulnerabilities (count,maxSeverity,details), recommended versions, filtered flags and filterReason required by the spec. In print-outdated.js, JSON mode bypasses vulnerability checks and always sets age to null, and error handling for JSON mode emits plain-text stderr or console.log, not a JSON object with an "error" field as specified. There are no tests covering JSON error output. </evidence>
  <notes>While the CLI flag, valid JSON, summary, default behavior and help documentation exist and tests pass for basic JSON mode, core acceptance criteria around complete data (vulnerabilities, severity, recommended versions, filter reasons) and JSON-formatted error handling are not implemented.</notes>
