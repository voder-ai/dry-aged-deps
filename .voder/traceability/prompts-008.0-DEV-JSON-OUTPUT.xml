  <evidence>Specification 008.0-DEV-JSON-OUTPUT.md requires JSON output to include for each package: name, current, latest, age, vulnerabilities (count, maxSeverity, details), filtered flags, filterReason, recommended version, and summary thresholds. However, src/json-formatter.js and the printOutdated JSON branch produce only {name,current,wanted,latest,age}. No vulnerabilities info, no filtered flags, no recommended, no filterReason. Moreover, exit codes in JSON mode are always 0 (no support for exit code 1 when updates exist), and JSON error output (with an error field) is not implemented. Although tests for minimal JSON pass, they do not cover the full schema or exit-code behavior defined in the spec.</evidence>
  <notes>The JSON formatter and CLI JSON branch implement only a minimal subset of the spec (timestamp, packages array, summary counts, thresholds) and do not satisfy the story’s acceptance criteria for complete data, exit codes, and error handling. Full JSON schema and exit-code logic remain unimplemented.</notes>
