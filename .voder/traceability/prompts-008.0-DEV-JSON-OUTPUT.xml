  <evidence>In src/print-outdated.js the JSON branch emits only name, current, wanted, latest, age (null) for each package and summary fields, e.g.:

  const rows = entries.map(([name, info]) => [name, info.current, info.wanted, info.latest, null]);
  console.log(jsonFormatter({ rows, summary, thresholds, timestamp }));

The jsonFormatter then maps array rows to objects with properties {name, current, wanted, latest, age} only.  It does not include vulnerabilities, severity thresholds, recommended versions, package type, filtered flag or filterReason as required by the spec (see prompts/008.0-DEV-JSON-OUTPUT.md).</evidence>
  <notes>The JSON output is syntactically valid and the CLI flag, summary, help text, error handling, and exit-code behavior in check mode are implemented and tested. However, the output omits critical fields (vulnerabilities, severity, recommended, type, filtered/filterReason) mandated by the story’s acceptance criteria, so the feature is incomplete.</notes>
