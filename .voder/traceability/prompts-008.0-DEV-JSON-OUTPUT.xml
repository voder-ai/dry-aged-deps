  <evidence>In src/print-outdated.js the JSON branch unconditionally serializes rows as simple arrays (name, current, wanted, latest, age) and jsonFormatter maps these arrays to objects with only {name, current, wanted, latest, age}. There is no vulnerabilities field, no type, no recommended, no filterReason in the CLI JSON output. For example, running `dry-aged-deps --format=json` (with DRY_AGED_DEPS_MOCK=1) yields package entries without any vulnerabilities information, despite the spec’s requirement (“Complete Data”) that each package object include vulnerabilities details and severity.</evidence>
  <notes>The implementation covers the basic JSON flag, exit codes, summary, thresholds, help text, and error formatting, but it omits critical fields specified in the story (per‐package vulnerabilities, severity, filtering metadata). To fully satisfy prompts/008.0-DEV-JSON-OUTPUT.md, the JSON output must be extended to include the additional package properties as defined in the spec.</notes>
