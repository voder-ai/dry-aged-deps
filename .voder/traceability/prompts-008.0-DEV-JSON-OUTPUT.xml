  <evidence>In src/print-outdated.js the JSON branch (format === 'json') is implemented as a "minimal" stub: it only collects rows as [name,current,wanted,latest,null] and invokes jsonFormatter, which emits an array of {name,current,wanted,latest,age} and a bare summary + thresholds. The story’s example schema and acceptance criteria require each package object to include fields for vulnerabilities (count, maxSeverity, details), filtered flags, filterReason, recommended version, dependency type, etc., and error output must be JSON-formatted with an "error" field. There is no code path that wraps CLI errors into a JSON error object. search in bin/dry-aged-deps.js shows that on error (format==='json') it falls back to console.error and a non-JSON exit, not the JSON-error schema. </evidence>
  <notes>The code only implements a minimal JSON formatter (name, current, wanted, latest, age) to satisfy a basic test suite, but does not provide the full, structured JSON schema (vulnerabilities, severity thresholds, filter metadata, recommended versions) nor JSON-formatted error objects as required by the spec. All acceptance criteria around "Complete Data" and "Error Handling" in JSON mode remain unimplemented.</notes>
