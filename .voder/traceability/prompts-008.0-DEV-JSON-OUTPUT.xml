  <evidence>In src/print-outdated-handlers.js, handleJsonOutput builds rows as simple arrays [name, current, wanted, latest, null] and calls jsonFormatter, which for array rows only outputs {name, current, wanted, latest, age}. There is no inclusion of vulnerabilities, maxSeverity, details, filtered, or filterReason as required by the spec. The tests for JSON output (e.g., test/cli.format-json.test.js and test/printOutdated.json.test.js) only assert on timestamp, packages array, summary and thresholds, never on vulnerability fields. No code path populates those fields in JSON mode.</evidence>
  <notes>Although CLI flag, exit codes, summary and thresholds, help text, and JSON validity are implemented and tested, the acceptance criterion “Complete Data: Includes all relevant information (name, current, latest, age, vulnerabilities, severity)” is not satisfied. JSON output omits vulnerability and filter information required by the story.</notes>
