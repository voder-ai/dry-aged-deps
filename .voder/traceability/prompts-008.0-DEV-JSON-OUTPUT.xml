  <evidence>The implementation in src/json-formatter.js and print-outdated.js only emits a minimal JSON with fields [name, current, wanted, latest, age] and summary counts. It does not include vulnerabilities details (count, maxSeverity, details), recommended versions, dependency type, filtered flags or filterReason as required by the spec. Moreover, error cases in JSON mode still write plain console.error messages and exit codes rather than a JSON object with an `error` field.</evidence>
  <notes>While the CLI flag, JSON validity, summary stats, help text, and exit-code semantics are present, the JSON output schema is incomplete and error handling in JSON mode is not formatted as JSON. Several acceptance criteria (complete data fields and JSON-formatted errors) are not met.</notes>
