  <evidence>Review of src/json-formatter.js shows the output schema only includes timestamp, packages (with name, current, wanted, latest, age) and summary (totalOutdated, safeUpdates, filteredByAge, filteredBySecurity, thresholds). It does NOT include a vulnerabilities object, severity info, recommended versions, filtered/filterReason fields as specified.

Further, bin/dry-aged-deps.js always exits with code 0 after printOutdated, regardless of whether updates are available, instead of using exit code 1 for available updates. The CLI error paths for JSON mode do not emit errors as JSON objects with an error field. Spec calls for exit codes: 0=no errors, 1=updates available, 2=error, and JSON‐formatted errors, which are not implemented.</evidence>
  <notes>The implementation and accompanying tests cover only a minimal JSON format (packages list and basic summary) and do not satisfy several acceptance criteria: full data including vulnerabilities and severity, correct exit codes based on update availability, and JSON‐formatted error handling.</notes>
