  <evidence>- CLI parsing in src/cli-options.js recognizes --update and --yes flags and bin/dry-aged-deps.js help text lists them.
- printOutdated in src/print-outdated.js implements update mode: shows preview, prompts (unless skipConfirmation), creates backup, writes package.json with 2-space indentation, logs summary and install reminder, and handles errors.
- Unit tests under test/printOutdated.update.test.js cover successful update, backup creation, summary, and install prompt.
- test/printOutdated.updateBackupError.test.js covers backup error handling.
- test/printOutdated.updatePromptAbort.test.js covers preview and abort flow.
- applyFilters ensures only safeRows are updated based on age and vulnerability filters.
- Integration with existing mature and security filters (dependencies on earlier stories) is exercised via stubbed helpers in tests.</evidence>
  <notes>All acceptance criteria for story 011.0-DEV-AUTO-UPDATE have been implemented and verified: update flag, safe-only updates, preview/confirm flow, --yes override, backup creation, post-update prompt, summary report, and error handling. Formatting preservation via JSON.stringify(…,2) maintains 2-space indent; property order follows original object order. No missing requirements detected.</notes>
