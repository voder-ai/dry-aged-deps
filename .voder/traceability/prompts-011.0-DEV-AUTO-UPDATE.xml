  <evidence>The auto-update feature is fully implemented and covered by automated tests. Key evidence:

1) CLI supports the --update and --yes flags (parseOptions in src/cli-options.js includes updateMode and skipConfirmation). The help text in bin/dry-aged-deps.js lists these flags.

2) printOutdated in src/print-outdated.js checks updateMode and delegates to updatePackages(safeRows, skipConfirmation, summary).

3) updatePackages in src/update-packages.js:
   - Logs preview of safeRows
   - Prompts for confirmation unless skipConfirmation is true
   - Creates backup file (package.json.backup) and logs success
   - Reads, modifies, and writes package.json with 2-space indent
   - Logs summary message and reminds user to run npm install
   - Gracefully handles backup or write errors by logging and returning summary

4) Unit tests in test/printOutdated.update.test.js verify:
   - Safe updates are applied, backup created, package.json updated, summary returned, and log messages
   - No safe updates branch: logs "No safe updates available." and does not create backup

5) Additional tests in test/printOutdated.updatePromptAbort.test.js and test/printOutdated.updateBackupError.test.js cover confirmation abort flow and backup error handling.

6) README.md includes usage examples for --update and --yes flags.

All acceptance criteria (update flag, safety filtering, format preservation, preview/confirm, yes flag, backup, install prompt, summary, error handling) are satisfied and exercised by the test suite.</evidence>
  <notes>The auto-update story (011.0-DEV-AUTO-UPDATE) has been fully implemented. All acceptance criteria are met, and the functionality is verified by comprehensive unit tests. CLI integration and documentation have been updated accordingly.</notes>
