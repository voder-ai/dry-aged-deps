  <evidence>1) All five Vitest tests in test/cli.check-mode.test.js passed, demonstrating correct flag parsing, exit codes (0, 1, 2), and JSON/XML output handling for --check mode.
2) The CLI help text (bin/dry-aged-deps.js) includes “--check” and describes its exit‐code behavior.
3) README.md includes --check in the options table but contains no CI/CD pipeline integration example (no GitHub Actions YAML or failure() snippet as specified).
4) There are no integration tests that simulate a CI/CD run (e.g. a YAML step or failure hook) verifying the documented pipeline usage.</evidence>
  <notes>The core functionality for --check mode is implemented and covered by unit tests, but the acceptance criterion around documentation (README showing CI/CD examples) and the corresponding integration tests are missing.</notes>
