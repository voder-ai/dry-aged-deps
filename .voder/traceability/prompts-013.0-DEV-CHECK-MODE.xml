  <evidence>All 6 tests in test/cli.check-mode.test.js passed, covering --check flag parsing, exit codes 0/1/2 in table, JSON, and XML modes, invalid-format errors, and threshold behavior. test/docs/ci-integration.test.js passed, verifying README.md and docs/api.md contain the CI/CD Integration section with --check usage and correct exit code semantics. The CLI implementation in bin/dry-aged-deps.js honors --check (sets returnSummary), emits clear output ('Outdated packages:' and package names), and exits with code 1 when summary.safeUpdates>0, 0 when none, and 2 on errors. README.md and docs/api.md include the CI/CD examples and exit code documentation.</evidence>
  <notes>The --check mode feature is fully implemented and covered by unit, functional, and documentation tests. All acceptance criteria (flag, exit codes, output, format support, error handling, docs) are satisfied.</notes>
