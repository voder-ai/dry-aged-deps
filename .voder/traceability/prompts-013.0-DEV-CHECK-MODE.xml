  <evidence>1. In bin/dry-aged-deps.js help output: “--check                 Check mode: exit code 1 if safe updates available, 0 if none, 2 on error (coming soon)”
2. No parsing of a `--check` flag in CLI argument handling (no code checks args for "--check").
3. No reference to check mode in exit code logic—always exits 0 on success, 2 on error, never 1 for available updates.
4. README.md still marks --check as “coming soon” and there are no tests for --check in the test suite.</evidence>
  <notes>The specification for --check mode exists, but none of the acceptance criteria are implemented. The CLI neither recognizes nor acts on a --check flag, the exit code logic has not been updated, output formats are unchanged, and there are no tests or documentation examples showing usage. Implementation is not present, so the story is failed.</notes>
