  <evidence>In bin/dry-aged-deps.js the help text lists --check as “(coming soon)”, but there is no parsing of a --check flag (no args.includes('--check') branch) and no code to change the exit code based on check mode. The CLI always runs printOutdated and then process.exit(0) on success, regardless of updates. No tests exercise a --check flag or verify exit code 1 when updates exist.</evidence>
  <notes>The specification’s acceptance criteria around check mode (REQ-CHECK-FLAG, REQ-EXIT-1-ON-UPDATES, check-mode behavior changes, JSON/XML support, tests, and documentation) are not implemented. The feature remains a stub in the help text only.</notes>
