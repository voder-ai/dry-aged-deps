  <evidence>- Tests in test/cli.check-mode.test.js reference prompts/013.0-DEV-CHECK-MODE.md and cover all acceptance criteria (5 tests) and all passed in `npm test` (128/128 passing).
- CLI code in bin/dry-aged-deps.js and src/cli-options.js implements `--check` (returnSummary), exits 1 on safe updates, 0 when none, 2 on errors, and supports --format=json/xml.
- Default table mode prints clear output including 'Outdated packages:' and package names (e.g., fakepkg) before failing.
- README.md includes the `--check` flag in the options table and shows a CI/CD integration example using `npx dry-aged-deps --check`.</evidence>
  <notes>All requirements from prompts/013.0-DEV-CHECK-MODE.md (flag support, exit codes, clear output, format support, documentation) are fully implemented and verified by tests and documentation.</notes>
