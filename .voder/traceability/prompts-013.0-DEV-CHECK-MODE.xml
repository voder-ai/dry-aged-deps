  <evidence>1. Test suite: `test/cli.check-mode.test.js` (6 tests) passes, exercising --check in default/table, JSON, XML modes, error conditions, and threshold edge case.  
2. Full Vitest run (`npm test`) completed with 150/150 tests passing (96.21% coverage), including all check-mode tests.  
3. Source: `src/cli-options.js` recognizes `--check`; `bin/dry-aged-deps.js` uses `returnSummary` to branch exit codes (0,1,2) per story.  
4. Documentation: `README.md` contains `--check` flag description, CI/CD usage examples, and matches acceptance criteria.  </evidence>
  <notes>All acceptance criteria for story 013.0-DEV-CHECK-MODE are satisfied: the CLI accepts `--check`, fails (exit 1) when safe updates exist, passes (exit 0) when up-to-date or filtered by thresholds, errors (exit 2) on invalid input or runtime errors; output is clear and supports table, JSON, and XML; README updated with examples.</notes>
