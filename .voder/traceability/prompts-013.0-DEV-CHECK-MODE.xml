  <evidence>1) Test suite 'test/cli.check-mode.test.js' (5 tests) passed: verifies --check flag, exit code 0 when no updates, exit code 1 on safe updates in table/JSON/XML, and exit code 2 on invalid format. 2) End-to-end `npm test` run: 43 files, 93 tests, all passing; coverage remains ≥89% branches. 3) Help text in bin/dry-aged-deps.js includes `--check`. 4) README.md and docs/api.md contain CI/CD integration section with `--check` usage and correct exit-code semantics (verified by test/docs/ci-integration.test.js).</evidence>
  <notes>All acceptance criteria for story 013.0-DEV-CHECK-MODE are implemented: the CLI supports `--check`, fails with exit 1 when safe updates exist, exits 0 when up-to-date, uses exit 2 on errors, shows outdated packages in table output, supports JSON/XML formats, and documentation has been updated with CI/CD examples.</notes>
