  <evidence>1) README.md still marks --check as “coming soon” and does not include the CI/CD usage examples from the spec. For example:

  | --check                 | Check mode: exit code 1 if safe updates available, 0 if none, 2 on error (coming soon) |
  …
  # dry-aged-deps --check (coming soon)

2) No CI/CD YAML snippet in README as required by “Documentation: README shows --check usage with CI/CD examples.”</evidence>
  <notes>All functional acceptance criteria (CLI flag, exit codes, clear output, JSON/XML support, unit tests) are implemented and tests pass, but the documentation has not been updated to include CI/CD examples. Per the spec’s acceptance criteria, the README must be updated with --check usage in a CI/CD context, so the story is not fully done.</notes>
