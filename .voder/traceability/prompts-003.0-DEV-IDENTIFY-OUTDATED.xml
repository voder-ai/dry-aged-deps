  <evidence>The code always uses the `latest` version for age filtering (see buildRows → fetchVersionTimes → age = calculateAgeInDays(versionTimes[info.latest])). The filterByAge function simply removes rows whose age < threshold for their dependency type. There is no logic iterating over `versionTimes` entries to "start from the latest and work backwards until finding a mature version" and then selecting that version. No tests cover selecting a fallback mature version when the latest is too new.</evidence>
  <notes>The ‘smart filtering’ acceptance criterion (selecting the newest mature version by walking backwards through all published versions) is not implemented. Only simple age-based filtering of the latest version is present, so the story is not fully satisfied.</notes>
