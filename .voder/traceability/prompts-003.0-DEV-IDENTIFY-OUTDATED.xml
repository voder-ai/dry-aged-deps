  <evidence>The core age‐filter (src/filter-by-age.js) and table output (src/print-outdated-handlers.js) only operate on the single “latest” version passed in from npm outdated. There is no implementation in buildRows or filter-by-age (or anywhere else) that walks back through the full versionTimes map to find the newest mature version older than 7 days. Tests (e.g. test/filter-by-age.test.js) only verify threshold filtering on the provided latest version and do not cover any fallback logic to earlier versions.</evidence>
  <notes>The story’s Smart Filtering requirement ("start from the latest and work backwards until finding mature version") is not implemented. Currently the tool simply filters out the latest version if it is too young, without selecting an earlier version. All other acceptance criteria (basic threshold filtering, no-mature messaging, output format, skip-current) appear covered.</notes>
