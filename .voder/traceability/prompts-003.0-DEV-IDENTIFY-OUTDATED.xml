  <evidence>The story requires “smart filtering” – i.e. for each package, walk backward through all published versions (from newest to oldest) until you find the first version ≥7 days old. In the current implementation:

• src/print-outdated.js only ever inspects `info.latest` (the single latest version from `npm outdated`).
• fetchVersionTimes() returns a map of all version timestamps, but printOutdated immediately picks only `versionTimes[info.latest]` and never iterates over earlier versions.
• src/filter-by-age.js simply filters rows on a pre-computed age value; there is no logic to scan multiple versions.
• There are zero tests in test/… that verify walking back through versions to find a mature release.

Because the core “smart filtering” requirement (REQ-SMART-SEARCH) is not implemented or tested, this story is not complete.</evidence>
  <notes>All other criteria (age threshold filtering of a single version, no-mature messaging, output formatting) are covered by code and tests, but the critical “walk versions until you find the first mature one” behavior is missing.</notes>
