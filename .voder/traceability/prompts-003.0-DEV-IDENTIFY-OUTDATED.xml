  <evidence>In src/print-outdated.js and src/filter-by-age.js, the code simply filters out rows whose latest version’s age < 7 days. There is no logic to ‘work backwards’ through older versions when the latest is too new (i.e. smart filtering), nor any comparison to skip to a mature version <= current. No tests reference or cover this behavior.</evidence>
  <notes>The story requires “smart filtering” (iterating from latest backwards to find the first mature version) and skipping if the mature version ≤ current. The implementation only drops entire packages when the latest version is too young, so key acceptance criteria are not met.</notes>
