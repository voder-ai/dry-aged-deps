  <evidence>The current implementation only evaluates the age of the single "latest" version per package (buildRows returns one row with info.latest) and filterByAge simply drops rows with age < threshold. There is no logic to iterate over older versions (smart filtering) to find the newest mature version. For example, src/filter-by-age.js only checks typeof age === 'number' && age >= minAge, and src/build-rows.js never builds rows for versions other than info.latest. The spec’s requirement “Smart Filtering: start from the latest and work backwards until finding a mature version” is not implemented.</evidence>
  <notes>Acceptance criteria for smart filtering (scanning older versions when the latest is too fresh) is not met. The code and tests only filter based on the latest version’s age, so additional logic is needed to satisfy the story.</notes>
