  <evidence>The implementation in src/filter-by-age.js simply filters rows where the age of the ‘latest’ version meets the threshold. It never fetches or considers earlier versions if the latest is too fresh. buildRows only retrieves the publish date for info.latest, not for all newer versions, so there is no ‘‘smart filtering’’ (looking backwards through prior versions) as required. There are no tests in test/* that validate selecting an older mature version when the latest is <7 days old.</evidence>
  <notes>Acceptance Criterion “Smart Filtering: Checks latest first, works backwards until finding mature version” is not implemented. The code only applies a simple threshold filter on the latest version’s age, so the story’s core requirement to fall back to the newest mature version is unmet.</notes>
