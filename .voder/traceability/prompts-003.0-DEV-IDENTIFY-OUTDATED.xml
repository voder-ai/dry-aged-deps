  <evidence>- src/filter-by-age.js implements the age threshold filter with prodMinAge and devMinAge
- src/print-outdated-handlers.js prints “No outdated packages with mature versions found” when no matureRows (filterByAge result) exist
- test/filter-by-age.test.js covers filterByAge behavior per prompts/003.0-DEV-FILTER-MATURE-VERSIONS.md
- Functional end-to-end test in test/functional-assessment.test.js validates story 003: running CLI with --min-age=1 and DRY_AGED_DEPS_MOCK forces no mature versions and outputs the expected message
- All related Vitest tests pass, and CLI outputs only mature versions when applicable</evidence>
  <notes>The implementation filters out packages whose latest version age is below the 7-day threshold (or custom threshold), prints a clear message when none are mature, and only shows mature updates. The existing tests and functional assessment confirm all acceptance criteria for story 003.0 are satisfied.</notes>
