  <evidence>The current implementation only filters on the age of the single “latest” version for each package (src/filter-by-age.js + buildRows in src/build-rows.js) and drops any package whose latest version is younger than 7 days. There is no code that iterates backwards through older versions to find the newest mature one (REQ-SMART-SEARCH). Neither buildRows nor applyFilters ever examines versions other than info.latest, and no tests cover a fallback to an older version. Thus the “Smart Filtering” acceptance criterion—“start from the latest and work backwards until we find a mature version”—is not implemented.</evidence>
  <notes>Core age-threshold filtering, missing-mature-message, and table/json output criteria are satisfied, but the smart backward search through version history is absent, so the story is not fully implemented.</notes>
