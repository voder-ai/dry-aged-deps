  <evidence>The `filterByAge` function (src/filter-by-age.js) simply filters rows by checking if the latest version’s age is ≥ the threshold. The `buildRows` function (src/build-rows.js) only ever calculates the age of the `info.latest` version and never attempts to search backwards through prior versions to find the first mature one. There is no code or tests that implement the “Smart Filtering” requirement (start from latest and work backwards until finding a mature version).</evidence>
  <notes>Acceptance criterion “Smart Filtering: Checks latest first, works backwards until finding mature version” (REQ-SMART-SEARCH) is not implemented. The code only filters by latest version age and does not fall back to older versions when the latest is too young.</notes>
