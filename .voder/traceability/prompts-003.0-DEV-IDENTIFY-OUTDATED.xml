  <evidence>In src/print-outdated.js (around line 66) the code always fetches and computes age only for info.latest and then applies filterByAge on those rows — there is no logic to iterate through earlier versions if the latest is younger than the threshold. filterByAge (src/filter-by-age.js) simply drops rows whose age < threshold; it does not implement “start from latest and work backwards until finding [the] mature version.”</evidence>
  <notes>The ‘smart filtering’ acceptance criterion (REQ-SMART-SEARCH) is not implemented. The code only considers the single latest version for each package rather than searching previous versions until finding one ≥7 days old.</notes>
