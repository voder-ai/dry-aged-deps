  <evidence>The implementation only filters the single “latest” version per package (in filterByAge and buildRows) and does not scan earlier versions to “work backwards until finding a mature version” as specified. There is no logic in fetch-version-times, buildRows, or applyFilters to examine older versions or adjust the recommended update to the newest mature release. Tests only verify filtering of the latest version’s age, not the smart backwards scan requirement.</evidence>
  <notes>Smart filtering (REQ-SMART-SEARCH) is missing: the code does not iterate over prior versions to find the first one ≥7 days old, so the story is not fully implemented.</notes>
