  <evidence>The implementation in src/filter-by-age.js simply filters the existing rows by checking whether the latest version’s age ≥ threshold. There is no code that, upon encountering a too-young latest version, walks backwards through earlier versions to find the newest mature version (i.e. no "smart filtering" logic). Additionally, the test suite only covers simple threshold filtering (test/filter-by-age.test.js) and does not include any tests for backward searching for mature versions as described in prompts/003.0-DEV-IDENTIFY-OUTDATED.md.</evidence>
  <notes>The acceptance criterion for "Smart Filtering" (start from the latest and work backwards until finding a mature version) has not been implemented. Only basic age‐threshold filtering for the latest version is present, so the story is not fully satisfied.</notes>
