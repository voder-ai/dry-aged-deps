  <evidence>In src/print-outdated.js, the implementation always checks only the single 'latest' version timestamp:

  const latestTime = versionTimes[info.latest];
  // ...
  const matureRows = filterByAge(rows, { prodMinAge, devMinAge });

There is no logic to iterate backwards through earlier versions to find the first mature one (REQ-SMART-SEARCH), nor any version comparison to ensure the selected mature version is strictly greater than the current version (REQ-COMPARISON). Furthermore, no tests cover selecting an intermediate mature version when the very latest is too young, or skipping when the mature version is <= current. These omissions mean smart filtering and comparison criteria are not met.</evidence>
  <notes>Core age filtering works (filterByAge covers REQ-AGE-THRESHOLD) and UI messages for no mature versions exist, but the smart search and version comparison requirements are not implemented, so the story is not satisfied.</notes>
