  <evidence>1) In src/print-outdated.js, when computing ages the code only ever looks at info.latest:

  const latestTime = versionTimes[info.latest];
  …
  const rows = await Promise.all(ageTasks);

 There is no iteration over older versions when the latest is too young.  

2) filterByAge (src/filter-by-age.js) simply filters out rows whose age < threshold—it does not implement “smart filtering” (walking backwards through older versions) as described in REQ-SMART-SEARCH.  

3) There are no tests covering the requirement to fall back to an older, mature version if the latest is younger than 7 days.  The existing filter-by-age.test.js only verifies filtering on a fixed set of rows, not smart version selection.</evidence>
  <notes>The story calls for “smart filtering” to start from the latest and then work backwards through version history until a mature (>=7 days) version is found. The current implementation only ever computes age on the latest version and filters it out if too new—there is no logic or tests for selecting a previous version. Therefore not all acceptance criteria are met.</notes>
