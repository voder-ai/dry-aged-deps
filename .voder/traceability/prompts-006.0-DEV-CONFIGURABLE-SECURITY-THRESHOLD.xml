  <evidence>• bin/dry-aged-deps.js parses --severity and valid levels (none, low, moderate, high, critical) and shows it in help, but does not read minSeverity from a .dry-aged-deps.json file (no config-file support).
• print-outdated passes prodMinSeverity/devMinSeverity but filter-by-security.js ignores those thresholds – it blocks any vulnerability count >0 rather than comparing vulnerability severity to the configured threshold.
• No code to load a config file or to apply a severity threshold when filtering. No tests reference severity levels or config precedence.</evidence>
  <notes>The CLI flag and valid levels are recognized, but config-file support and the filtering logic based on severity thresholds are not implemented. The filter function blocks all vulnerabilities regardless of the chosen severity threshold, and .dry-aged-deps.json support is missing.</notes>
