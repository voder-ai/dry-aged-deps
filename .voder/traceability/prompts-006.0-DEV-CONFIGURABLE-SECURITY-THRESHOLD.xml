  <evidence>1) test/filter-by-security-severity.test.js (Story: prompts/006.0-DEV-CONFIGURABLE-SECURITY-THRESHOLD.md) verifies that filterBySecurity honors the five severity levels, blocks at-or-above threshold, and defaults correctly.  
2) CLI flag handling in src/cli-options.js and src/cli-options-helpers.js supports `--severity=<level>`, validates allowed values (none, low, moderate, high, critical), and exits with code 2 on invalid or missing values.  
3) test/cli.flags.test.js covers invalid/missing `--severity`, defaulting to "none", and accepts all valid levels.  
4) Config‐file support in src/config-loader.js and src/cli-options.js reads `severity` and `prod.minSeverity`/`dev.minSeverity` from `.dry-aged-deps.json`, with precedence CLI > config > default, as confirmed by test/cli.config-file.test.js.  
5) Help text in bin/dry-aged-deps.js includes the `--severity` option and lists the valid levels.  
6) JSON and XML outputs include a `thresholds` section showing the applied `minSeverity` values (verified by JSON‐output tests and xml‐formatter threshold tests).</evidence>
  <notes>All acceptance criteria for Configurable Security Threshold are fully satisfied: the CLI flag exists and is validated; config file loading honors `minSeverity`; the five severity levels are supported; filtering blocks vulnerabilities at or above the threshold; CLI flags override config; default behavior blocks all vulnerabilities; invalid inputs are rejected; help documentation includes the option; and outputs clearly show which thresholds were applied.</notes>
