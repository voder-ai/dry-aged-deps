  <evidence>In src/filter-by-security.js the code always does `if (vulnCount !== 0) include = false`, completely ignoring the configured `prodMinSeverity`/`devMinSeverity`. There is no logic that compares the actual vulnerability severities against the threshold, and no tests cover conditional allowance of low/moderate issues when the threshold is higher.</evidence>
  <notes>The story’s core acceptance criterion—only blocking vulnerabilities at or above a user-specified severity threshold—is not implemented. The filterBySecurity helper never uses the configured severity levels to distinguish low/moderate/high/critical, so any non-zero vulnerability count is always blocked regardless of the threshold.</notes>
