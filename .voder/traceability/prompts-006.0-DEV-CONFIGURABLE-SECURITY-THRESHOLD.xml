  <evidence>In src/filter-by-security.js, the thresholds (prodMinSeverity, devMinSeverity) are passed in but never used—the code simply blocks any nonzero vulnerability count, ignoring severity levels. No logic compares vulnerability severities against the configured threshold. Additionally, the config parser in bin/dry-aged-deps.js reads a top-level config.severity key (not minSeverity as specified) and there are no tests covering severity thresholds or config precedence for severity.</evidence>
  <notes>The configurable security threshold story is not implemented. The filtering logic does not respect severity thresholds, and config file support for minSeverity at the root level is inconsistent with the spec. No tests verify the new functionality.</notes>
