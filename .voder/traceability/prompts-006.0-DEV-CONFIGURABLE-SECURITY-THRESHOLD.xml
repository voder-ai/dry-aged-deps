  <evidence>In src/filter-by-security.js the code always blocks any non-zero vulnerability (if (vulnCount !== 0) include = false) and never compares vulnCount or actual vulnerability severities against the configured threshold (prodMinSeverity/devMinSeverity). Additionally, checkVulnerabilities only returns a count, not per-severity data, and tests (e.g., test/filter-by-security.test.js and functional tests) do not cover any threshold-based filtering behavior. There is no logic to allow vulnerabilities below the threshold.</evidence>
  <notes>The feature to configure and apply a minimum severity threshold is not implemented. All vulnerabilities are blocked regardless of the configured threshold, and there are no tests verifying threshold filtering.</notes>
