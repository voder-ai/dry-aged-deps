  <evidence>1. No config file support: neither bin/dry-aged-deps.js nor src/print-outdated.js reads `.dry-aged-deps.json` or a `minSeverity` property.
2. Severity threshold logic not implemented: in src/print-outdated.js the vulnerability filter always excludes any package with a non-zero vulnerability count, ignoring the `prodMinSeverity`/`devMinSeverity` options entirely. It never parses per-vulnerability severity from `npm audit` output.
3. Tests cover CLI flag parsing for `--severity` but there are no unit or integration tests verifying filtering behavior based on different severity thresholds.</evidence>
  <notes>The story’s acceptance criteria around config-file support, configurable filtering logic by severity level, and output messages indicating applied thresholds are not met. Severity thresholds are parsed but never enforced, and configuration files are never read. Implementation and tests must be added for these features.</notes>
