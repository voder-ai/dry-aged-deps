  <evidence>1. The CLI parses --severity flags (bin/dry-aged-deps.js lines 129–147) and the help text shows the option, and tests in test/cli.flags.test.js verify valid/invalid values and defaults.
2. However, there is no code that reads a minSeverity value from a .dry-aged-deps.json config file (no references to .dry-aged-deps.json in src or bin).
3. The core filtering logic in src/print-outdated.js (around lines 130–150) simply excludes any package with a nonzero vulnerability count, ignoring the configured threshold; it never compares actual vulnerability severities against the minSeverity setting.
4. No unit or integration tests cover filtering by severity threshold or config-file precedence.
</evidence>
  <notes>While flag parsing, help text, validation, and default behavior are partly implemented, the story’s key features—config file support and threshold‐based filtering logic—are missing. Therefore the acceptance criteria are not fully satisfied.</notes>
