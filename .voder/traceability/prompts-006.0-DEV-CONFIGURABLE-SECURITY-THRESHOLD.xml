  <evidence>In src/filter-by-security.js (lines 18–24), the code unconditionally blocks any package with vulnCount !== 0, ignoring the configured threshold:

  vulnCount = await checkVulnerabilities(name, latest);
  if (vulnCount !== 0) {
    include = false;
    filterReasonMap.set(name, 'security');
  }

There is no comparison of actual vulnerability severities against the prodMinSeverity/devMinSeverity values, nor does checkVulnerabilities return severity data. The acceptance criterion “Filtering Logic: Blocks packages with vulnerabilities at or above the threshold” is not implemented. No tests cover configurable severity behavior, and check-vulnerabilities only returns a count, not severity information.</evidence>
  <notes>The code parses and displays a --severity flag and config file values, but never applies them to filter logic. To satisfy the story, checkVulnerabilities must extract and return per-severity data and filterBySecurity must compare max severity against the configured threshold. Until these are implemented and tested, the story is not complete.</notes>
