  <evidence>1) CLI parsing (bin/dry-aged-deps.js) supports --severity flags and validation:
   • validSeverities defined as ['none','low','moderate','high','critical']
   • Default minSeverity='none'
   • Help text includes --severity and valid values

2) No config-file support:
   • Help text flags --config-file as "coming soon"
   • No code reading .dry-aged-deps.json anywhere in src or bin

3) Filtering logic (src/filter-by-security.js) ignores severity thresholds:
   • Always blocks any package with vulnCount>0 regardless of threshold
   • Does not inspect actual vulnerability severity levels
   • Uses minSeverity only to set vulnMap.maxSeverity, not to decide blocking

4) No tests found referencing severity or config precedence in test/ directory
</evidence>
  <notes>The CLI flag and help text for --severity exist, and severity levels are validated. However, the implementation does not read config files, does not apply any threshold filtering logic (it simply blocks all vulnerabilities regardless of level), and lacks tests or output messaging reflecting the configured threshold. Therefore, the story is not fully implemented.</notes>
