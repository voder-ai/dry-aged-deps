  <evidence>The CLI and config correctly parse and propagate severity flags (bin/dry-aged-deps.js lines ~200–300), but filterBySecurity (src/filter-by-security.js) unconditionally blocks any package with vulnCount > 0, ignoring the configured prodMinSeverity/devMinSeverity thresholds. There is no logic comparing actual vulnerability severities to the threshold, nor are there tests covering severity-level behavior (no tests reference "severity").</evidence>
  <notes>Severity thresholds are parsed but never applied: all vulnerabilities are blocked regardless of the configured level. Filtering logic and tests for configurable severity are missing.</notes>
