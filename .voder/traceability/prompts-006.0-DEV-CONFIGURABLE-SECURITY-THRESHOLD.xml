  <evidence>In src/filter-by-security.js, the function completely ignores the configured prodMinSeverity/devMinSeverity when deciding to filter a row. It simply does:

  if (vulnCount !== 0) {
    include = false;
    filterReasonMap.set(name, 'security');
  }

and never inspects actual vulnerability severities from `checkVulnerabilities`. There are no code paths or tests that gate filtering based on the configured threshold (e.g. allow low/moderate when threshold is 'high').</evidence>
  <notes>All other acceptance points (CLI flag, config support, help text, validation, output of thresholds in JSON/XML) are implemented, but the core filtering‐logic requirement—block only vulnerabilities at or above the user‐configurable severity—has not been implemented.</notes>
