  <evidence>1. No code to read a .dry-aged-deps.json config file: search for “.dry-aged-deps.json” yields nothing; bin/dry-aged-deps.js only mentions “--config-file” in help text as “coming soon” and nowhere parses or loads a config file.
2. No tests cover config-file support or reading a “minAge” from a config file: test directory contains no reference to config file or config loading.
3. Although --min-age flag, validation, default of 7, override behavior, help text, and JSON output thresholds (minAge) are implemented (and covered by existing cli.flags.test.js), the core requirement of config file support (REQ-CONFIG-FILE, REQ-CONFIG-SCHEMA, REQ-PRECEDENCE for config) is missing.</evidence>
  <notes>The implementation fully supports the CLI flag (--min-age), its validation, default value, help documentation, and JSON output changes, but does not implement reading or merging of configuration from a .dry-aged-deps.json file. As a result, the story’s acceptance criteria for config file support and CLI override precedence are not met.</notes>
