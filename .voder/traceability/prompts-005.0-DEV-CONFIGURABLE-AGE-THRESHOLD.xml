  <evidence>In bin/dry-aged-deps.js there is no logic to read or parse a `.dry-aged-deps.json` file (REQ-CONFIG-FILE), nor is there any handling of a `minAge` property from such a file. The code only parses `--min-age` (CLI flag) or falls back to the hardcoded default of 7. There are no references to `.dry-aged-deps.json` in src/ or bin/, and no tests in the test/ directory cover config-file loading or precedence scenarios.</evidence>
  <notes>The CLI flag, validation, default behavior, help text, and threshold output in certain messages are implemented, but support for reading a config file and CLI-over-config precedence is entirely missing. Unit and integration tests for config-file scenarios are also absent.</notes>
