  <evidence>1) In bin/dry-aged-deps.js --help output: "--config-file=<file>    Configuration-file support (coming soon)" (no real implementation).
2) No code paths import or read a ".dry-aged-deps.json" file (search for ".dry-aged-deps.json" and "minAge" in the code yields zero hits).
3) No tests reference loading configuration from a file or exercising precedence of config vs CLI flag.</evidence>
  <notes>The CLI flag (--min-age) with validation, defaulting, help text, and JSON/table output support are implemented and tested, but the story’s requirement to read `minAge` from a `.dry-aged-deps.json` config file (and to have CLI override it) is not implemented and has no accompanying tests.</notes>
