  <evidence>• Code in bin/dry-aged-deps.js executes `npm outdated --json` via child_process (execFileSync)
• JSON.parse of the output is wrapped in try/catch in both command and parseError branches
• printOutdated → handleTableOutput displays “Outdated packages:” header, columns, and rows
• No‐outdated case prints “All dependencies are up to date.” (tested by test/cli.upToDate.test.js)
• Error on invalid JSON is caught and exits with code 2 (tested by test/cli.error-cmd.test.js and cli.format-json.error.test.js)
• Integration tests for real fixtures (test/cli.outdated.test.js) and mocks (test/cli.outdated.mock.test.js) all pass
• Full Vitest suite (163 tests) passes with 93.5% statement coverage</evidence>
  <notes>All acceptance criteria of prompts/001.0-DEV-RUN-NPM-OUTDATED.md are satisfied: running npm outdated, parsing JSON, displaying results, handling errors, and handling no‐update scenarios. CLI help text and documentation cover usage examples.</notes>
