  <evidence>The implementation in bin/dry-aged-deps.js uses execFileSync('npm', ['outdated','--json']) and JSON.parse to load data. The printOutdated ➔ handleTableOutput path prints “Outdated packages:” with the expected header and rows, and handleNoOutdated prints “All dependencies are up to date.” Tests covering this story all pass:

• test/functional-assessment.test.js: 001.0-DEV-RUN-NPM-OUTDATED assertion passes.  
• test/cli.outdated.test.js & test/cli.outdated.mock.test.js verify real and mocked output.  
• test/cli.upToDate.test.js verifies the no-updates scenario.  
• test/cli.error-cmd.test.js verifies error handling when npm outdated output is invalid JSON.  

All relevant Vitest tests exit with the correct codes and output, and the CI run shows 206/206 tests passing with >97% coverage.</evidence>
  <notes>Story 001.0-DEV-RUN-NPM-OUTDATED is fully implemented: npm outdated is invoked, JSON is parsed, results are displayed in table form, and both error and no-update cases are handled and tested.</notes>
