  <evidence>Vitest test suite ran successfully with 164/164 tests passing (including test/cli.outdated.test.js for running and displaying npm outdated output, test/cli.upToDate.test.js for no-updates case, and test/cli.error-cmd.test.js for error handling of invalid JSON). The CLI invokes `npm outdated --json`, parses its output, displays a table by default, handles failures with exit code 2 and error messages, and prints “All dependencies are up to date.” when there are no outdated packages.</evidence>
  <notes>All acceptance criteria for story 001.0-DEV-RUN-NPM-OUTDATED (running npm outdated, JSON parsing, displaying results, error handling, no-updates handling) are fully satisfied and covered by tests.</notes>
