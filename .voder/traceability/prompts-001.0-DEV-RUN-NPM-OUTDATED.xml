  <evidence>• The bin/dry-aged-deps.js entrypoint invokes execFileSync('npm', ['outdated','--json']) and JSON.parse, with try/catch handling for both command failures and parse errors.
• printOutdated in src/print-outdated.js covers display of outdated packages, the “All dependencies are up to date.” message when data is empty, and error/output formatting for table, JSON, and XML modes.
• Vitest suite ran 80 tests across 38 files (including cli.outdated.test.js, cli.upToDate.test.js, cli.outdated.mock.test.js, cli.error-cmd.test.js), all passing. The CLI E2E and unit tests cover core functionality, parsing, display, error handling, and no-updates scenarios.
• “npm test” output shows 100% passing and >98% coverage, confirming full implementation of acceptance criteria.</evidence>
  <notes>All acceptance criteria (running npm outdated, parsing JSON output, displaying results, handling errors, and the no-updates case) are implemented and exhaustively tested. CLI help/version flags, unit and integration tests, and documentation in README satisfy the Definition of Done for this foundational story.</notes>
