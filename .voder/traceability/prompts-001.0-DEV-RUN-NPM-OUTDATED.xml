  <evidence>– The CLI implementation in bin/dry-aged-deps.js invokes execFileSync('npm',['outdated','--json'],…) and catches errors per REQ-NPM-COMMAND and REQ-JSON-PARSE.
– src/print-outdated.js parses the JSON, handles entries.length===0 (no updates) by printing “All dependencies are up to date.”, and renders outdated packages in table/json/xml formats (REQ-OUTPUT-DISPLAY).
– Error handling paths are covered: execFileSync errors, JSON parse errors, and upstream printOutdated exceptions all produce proper exit codes and output.
– Vitest suite (89 tests) ran with zero failures, including cli.outdated.test.js (outdated scenario), cli.upToDate.test.js (no updates), cli.error-cmd.test.js (npm outdated failure), and printOutdated unit tests. Coverage is 98.4% statements, 100% lines, 100% functions, and 89.8% branches.</evidence>
  <notes>All acceptance criteria (core functionality, JSON parsing, display format, error handling, and no‐updates case) from the 001.0-DEV-RUN-NPM-OUTDATED story are fully implemented and comprehensively tested.</notes>
