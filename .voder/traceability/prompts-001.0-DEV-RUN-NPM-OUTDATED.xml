  <evidence>All 93 Vitest tests across 43 files passed (including cli.outdated.test.js, cli.outdated.mock.test.js, cli.upToDate.test.js, cli.error-cmd.test.js) with 97.61% statements and 89.01% branches coverage. The CLI entrypoint (bin/dry-aged-deps.js) invokes `npm outdated --json`, parses its output, and delegates to src/print-outdated.js, which correctly handles displaying outdated packages, the no‐updates case (‘All dependencies are up to date.’), and error scenarios (invalid JSON or execution failure).</evidence>
  <notes>The implementation fulfills all acceptance criteria: core functionality executes `npm outdated --json`, output is parsed and displayed in human and JSON/XML formats, errors in running or parsing npm outdated are handled with appropriate exit codes, and the no‐updates path is correctly rendered. Comprehensive unit, E2E, and integration tests cover edge cases and confirm behavior.</notes>
