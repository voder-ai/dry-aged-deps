  <evidence>• prompts/001.0-DEV-RUN-NPM-OUTDATED.md exists as a valid user‐story/spec with clear acceptance criteria.
• bin/dry-aged-deps.js invokes execFileSync('npm', ['outdated','--json']), catches errors, handles stdout, parses JSON and exits with proper codes.
• src/print-outdated.js implements parsing of the JSON data, table/json/xml output, handles no‐updates (entries.length===0 → “All dependencies are up to date.”), and error branches.
• Two Vitest suites cover this story:
  – test/cli.outdated.mock.test.js (mocked outdated data) → passes, asserts header and fakepkg row.
  – test/cli.outdated.test.js (real fixture project) → passes, asserts exit code 0, header “Outdated packages:” and at least one real package.
• CI evidence (from current cycle): all lint, type, format checks pass; 128 tests (incl. cli.outdated) pass; coverage > 90%.</evidence>
  <notes>All acceptance criteria for story 001.0 (running `npm outdated --json`, parsing output, displaying results, handling failures and no‐update scenarios) are fully implemented and covered by unit and E2E tests. The CLI prints the expected headers, handles errors, and reports when no packages are outdated.</notes>
