  <evidence>• In bin/dry-aged-deps.js: execFileSync('npm',['outdated','--json']) is used to run npm outdated in JSON mode, with JSON.parse and error handlers for both command failures and parse failures.
• In src/print-outdated.js: parsed data is transformed into table, JSON, and XML outputs, with separate handling for no-outdated scenario (‘All dependencies are up to date.’).
• Comprehensive Vitest suite (39 files, 87 tests) passes (see npm test output). Tests cover: real‐fixture outdated, up‐to‐date, mock outdated, JSON and XML formats, parse errors, CLI flags and help, config file, check mode, and edge cases.</evidence>
  <notes>All acceptance criteria are satisfied. The CLI runs npm outdated --json, parses the output, displays results (table, JSON, XML), handles failures (command and parse errors), and handles the no-updates case. Unit and integration tests are in place and passing, and documentation/CLI help is implemented.</notes>
