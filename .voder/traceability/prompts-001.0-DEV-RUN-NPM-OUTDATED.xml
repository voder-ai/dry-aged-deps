  <evidence>The CLI entrypoint (bin/dry-aged-deps.js) invokes `execFileSync('npm',['outdated','--json'])`, parses the JSON, and delegates to printOutdated which logs table output. The no-outdated case prints “All dependencies are up to date.” (covered by test/cli.upToDate.test.js), the outdated case prints the header and package rows (covered by test/cli.outdated.test.js), and JSON parsing errors and command failures exit with code 2 (covered by test/cli.error-cmd.test.js). All related lint, typecheck, and vitest runs pass.</evidence>
  <notes>All acceptance criteria for story 001.0 (run npm outdated, parse JSON, display results, handle errors and no-update cases) are fully implemented and verified by unit and integration tests.</notes>
