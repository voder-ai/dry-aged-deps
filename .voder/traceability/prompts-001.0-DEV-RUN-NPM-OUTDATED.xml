  <evidence>The CLI entrypoint (bin/dry-aged-deps.js) invokes `execFileSync('npm', ['outdated','--json'])`, parses the JSON output, and on success delegates to print-outdated which prints a human-readable table.  Error cases are caught and produce exit code 2 with appropriate error messages (e.g. invalid JSON test in test/cli.error-cmd.test.js).  When there are no outdated packages, it prints “All dependencies are up to date.” and exits 0 (verified by test/cli.upToDate.test.js).  When there are outdated packages, it prints “Outdated packages:” and the header row, then package rows, and exits 1 (verified by test/cli.outdated.test.js).</evidence>
  <notes>All acceptance criteria for story 001.0 (running npm outdated, parsing JSON, displaying results, error handling, and no-updates handling) are fully implemented and covered by tests.</notes>
