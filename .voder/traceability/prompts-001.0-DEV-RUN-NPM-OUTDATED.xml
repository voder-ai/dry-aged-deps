  <evidence>• bin/dry-aged-deps.js invokes execFileSync('npm', ['outdated','--json']) and handles stdout errors (lines 512–560)
• JSON.parse of npm outdated output and catch for parse errors with appropriate exit codes
• printOutdated displays ‘Outdated packages:’ table, handles empty data (‘All dependencies are up to date.’) and error paths
• Vitest suite includes tests covering: mocked outdated output (cli.outdated.mock.test.js), real outdated integration (cli.outdated.test.js), no-updates scenario (cli.upToDate.test.js), and error on invalid JSON (cli.error-cmd.test.js)
• npm test → 89/89 tests passed, coverage ≥80%
• README.md and CLI help include usage examples of running the command</evidence>
