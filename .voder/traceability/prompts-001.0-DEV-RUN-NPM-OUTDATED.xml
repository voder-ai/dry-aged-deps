  <evidence>• All 62 Vitest tests passed, including cli.outdated.test.js, cli.upToDate.test.js, cli.error-cmd.test.js, cli.outdated.mock.test.js, and the real‐fixture E2E test (cli.e2e.real-fixture.test.js).
• bin/dry-aged-deps.js invokes execFileSync('npm',['outdated','--json']), catches errors, parses JSON, and calls printOutdated.
• printOutdated handles empty data by printing “All dependencies are up to date.” and errors by exiting with appropriate codes.
• CLI help and version flags implemented and tested (cli-entrypoint.test.js).
• README and CLI help text document usage examples and options.</evidence>
  <notes>The foundation story “Run npm outdated” is fully implemented. Core functionality runs npm outdated --json, parses output, displays results, handles errors and the no-updates case; all related tests pass. Additional features (format flags, age/security filters) are extensions beyond this story and do not interfere with the requirements.</notes>
