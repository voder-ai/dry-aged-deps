  <evidence>The CLI entrypoint (bin/dry-aged-deps.js) invokes execFileSync('npm', ['outdated','--json'],…) to run npm outdated per REQ-NPM-COMMAND, parses the output with JSON.parse (REQ-JSON-PARSE), and delegates to printOutdated which prints a table via handleTableOutput (REQ-OUTPUT-DISPLAY). Error cases are covered: invalid JSON or failing npm command exit with code 2 and appropriate messages (tested in test/cli.error-cmd.test.js and test/cli.format-json.error.test.js). The E2E test with DRY_AGED_DEPS_MOCK=1 (test/cli.e2e.real-fixture.test.js) verifies default table output shows header and data rows. Type-checking, linting, and tests pass with 97.6% coverage as documented in the current cycle assessment.</evidence>
  <notes>All acceptance criteria for story 001.0 are satisfied: npm outdated is executed and JSON output parsed, outdated packages are displayed in table format, errors are handled, and a no-updates scenario is implemented. The extensive test suite confirms core functionality, parsing, display, and error behavior.</notes>
