  <evidence>• The CLI entrypoint (bin/dry-aged-deps.js) invokes `npm outdated --json` via execFileSync and captures stdout/stderr.
• JSON parsing of the `npm outdated` output is handled in both initial child_process block and in the catch for invalid JSON.
• The `printOutdated` function (src/print-outdated.js) and its handlers (src/print-outdated-handlers.js) render table output with header “Outdated packages:” and columns Name, Current, Wanted, Latest, Age (days), Type.
• No‐update case prints “All dependencies are up to date.” (tested in test/cli.upToDate.test.js).
• Error scenarios are handled: invalid JSON from npm (exit code 2, stderr contains “Failed to parse npm outdated output”; tested in test/cli.error-cmd.test.js), JSON‐format error output and XML‐format error output (tested in test/cli.format-json.error.test.js and test/cli.format-xml.error.test.js).
• End-to-end test for outdated fixtures passes (test/cli.outdated.test.js) and mocked outdated data is supported (test/cli.outdated.mock.test.js).
• Full Vitest suite passes (150 tests, 96.2%+ coverage)</evidence>
  <notes>All acceptance criteria from prompts/001.0-DEV-RUN-NPM-OUTDATED.md are satisfied: the CLI runs npm outdated, parses JSON output, displays results, and correctly handles both error cases and the no‐updates case. Unit and integration tests cover the core functionality. Continuous integration reports all tests passing.</notes>
