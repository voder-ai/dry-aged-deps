  <evidence>• Found implementation in bin/dry-aged-deps.js that invokes `npm outdated --json` via child_process (execFileSync).
• JSON parsing in bin/dry-aged-deps.js and error handling branches for command failure and invalid JSON.
• printOutdated in src/print-outdated.js handles display of outdated packages (table output), no-updates case (`All dependencies are up to date.`), and error scenarios (exit code 2, JSON/XML error blocks).
• Vitest suite includes end-to-end CLI tests:
  – test/cli.outdated.test.js verifies ‘Outdated packages:’ table on a project with outdated deps.
  – test/cli.upToDate.test.js verifies the no-update message for up-to-date projects.
  – test/cli.error-cmd.test.js and test/cli.format-json.error.test.js verify error handling when npm outdated fails or outputs invalid JSON.
• All 142 tests passed (including those covering our acceptance criteria) with 96%+ coverage (see `npm test` output).</evidence>
  <notes>All acceptance criteria for story 001.0-DEV-RUN-NPM-OUTDATED have been met: core functionality runs npm outdated, JSON is parsed, results are displayed, errors are handled, and the no-updates case is covered. Comprehensive tests exist and are passing.</notes>
