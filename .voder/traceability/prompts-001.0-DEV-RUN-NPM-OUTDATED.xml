  <evidence>All 94 Vitest tests passed including CLI integration tests (test/cli.outdated.test.js, test/cli.upToDate.test.js, test/cli.error-cmd.test.js). The bin/dry-aged-deps.js entrypoint invokes `npm outdated --json` via child_process, JSON.parse’s the output, handles error cases (invalid JSON, command failure), and prints either a table of outdated packages or “All dependencies are up to date.” printOutdated.js covers display logic and edge cases. README and --help text document usage. CI pipeline reports 96.96% statement coverage, 100% functions covered.</evidence>
  <notes>The core functionality of running `npm outdated --json`, parsing its JSON output, displaying outdated packages, handling command failures, and the no-updates case are fully implemented and verified by unit and integration tests. Documentation and CLI help text are in place.</notes>
