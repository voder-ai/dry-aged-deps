  <evidence>No code or tests referencing prompts/004.0-DEV-FILTER-VULNERABLE-VERSIONS.md were found. Searches for audit, vulnerability, checkVulnerabilities, or story traceability annotations in src/ and test/ directories returned no results. No implementation of REQ-AUDIT-CHECK, REQ-TRANSITIVE-DEPS, REQ-SMART-SEARCH, REQ-SAFE-ONLY, or REQ-CLEAR-OUTPUT discovered.</evidence>
  <notes>The specification for filtering out vulnerable versions exists as a prompt, but there is no corresponding implementation or tests in the codebase. Acceptance criteria are unmet, so the story is marked as FAILED.</notes>
