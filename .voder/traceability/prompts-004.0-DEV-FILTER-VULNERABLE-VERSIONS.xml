  <evidence>Review of src/filter-by-security.js and src/print-outdated.js shows that for each package the code always checks only the single "latest" version and simply filters it out if vulnerable. There is no implementation of “smart checking” that walks backward through multiple mature versions until finding a safe one. No tests cover a scenario where the latest mature version is vulnerable but a prior mature version is safe. The acceptance criterion “Smart Checking: Checks newest mature first, works backwards until finding safe version” is not implemented.</evidence>
  <notes>While core vulnerability checking (direct and transitive via npm audit), security filtering, clear output formatting, and no‐safe‐version messaging are implemented and tested, the key requirement to iterate through mature versions in descending order to find the first safe release is missing.</notes>
