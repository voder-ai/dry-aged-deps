  <evidence>In src/filter-by-security.js and src/print-outdated.js the code only checks the single latest version for vulnerabilities and outright filters it if vulnerable. There is no logic to fetch or iterate over earlier mature versions ‘working backwards’ until finding a safe one. Tests in test/filter-by-security.test.js validate simple filtering of a single version but do not cover selecting an earlier version when the newest is vulnerable.</evidence>
  <notes>The core vulnerability check and output formatting are implemented, but the smart-search requirement (start from newest mature version and work backwards to find a safe one) is not satisfied. Instead, vulnerable latest versions are simply discarded, so no alternative safe version is ever recommended.</notes>
