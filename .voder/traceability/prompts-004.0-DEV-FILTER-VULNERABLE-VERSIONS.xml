  <evidence>The implementation in src/filter-by-security.js and related CLI orchestration only checks the single latest version per package via checkVulnerabilities(name, latest) and filters it out if any vulnerabilities exist. There is no logic to iterate backwards through older mature versions (REQ-SMART-SEARCH), nor is the configurable severity threshold ever applied (the thresholds parameter is passed in but ignored), and vulnerability details are never populated. No code or tests address selecting the newest safe version when the latest is vulnerable. Therefore Smart Checking and severity-threshold requirements are not met.</evidence>
  <notes>While basic vulnerability filtering is implemented and tested, the story’s key acceptance criteria around smart backward searching through mature versions and applying severity thresholds have not been implemented.</notes>
