  <evidence>– Found src/xml-formatter.js implementing xmlFormatter with proper declaration, packages, summary, thresholds and error handling.
– cli-options.js and cli-options-helpers.js accept and validate `--format=xml` alongside table/json.
– bin/dry-aged-deps.js prints XML via xmlFormatter on `--format=xml`, suppresses other logs, and exits with codes 0/1/2 as specified.
– README.md, docs/api.md and CLI help text list xml as a valid format.
– 45 test files, including test/xml-formatter.*.test.js and test/cli.format-xml*.test.js, cover XML output, escaping, schema, error handling, exit codes, and run with zero failures under `npm test` (128 passed).</evidence>
  <notes>All acceptance criteria for prompts/009.0-DEV-XML-OUTPUT.md have concrete implementation and automated test coverage. XML output is well-formed, includes complete data, summary, thresholds, error blocks, proper exit codes, no extra console noise, and documentation/help is updated.</notes>
