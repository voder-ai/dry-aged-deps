  <evidence>In bin/dry-aged-deps.js the main routine always calls `process.exit(0)` after a successful run, even when updates are available. The story’s acceptance criteria specify exit code 1 for “updates available”, but there is no code path setting exit code 1 in that case.</evidence>
  <notes>All other XML formatter behaviors (CLI flag, valid XML, full data, summary, error handling, schema, help text) are implemented and well-tested. However, the required exit-code semantics for signaling available updates (exit code 1) has not been implemented.</notes>
