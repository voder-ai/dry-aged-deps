  <evidence>- The CLI help in bin/dry-aged-deps.js lists “--config-file=<file>    Configuration-file support (coming soon)”, but no code parses a --config-file flag or reads prod/dev settings from a config file.
- No code in main() or printOutdated() reads a config file or merges config-file thresholds; config schema REQ-CONFIG-SCHEMA is not implemented.
- No tests in test/ cover config-file support, and searching the codebase shows no handling of config-file input.</evidence>
  <notes>All other acceptance criteria around CLI flags, fallback behavior, defaults, validation, dependency type detection, and output indication are implemented and tested. However, the required config-file support for prod/dev thresholds is not implemented, so the story is not complete.</notes>
