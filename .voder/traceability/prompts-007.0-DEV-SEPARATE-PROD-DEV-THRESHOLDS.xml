  <evidence>• CLI code (bin/dry-aged-deps.js) prints “--config-file=<file> (coming soon)” but never parses or reads a config file; no implementation of REQ-CONFIG-SCHEMA or config-file support.
• No tests in test/cli.flags.test.js or elsewhere exercise the --prod-min-age, --dev-min-age, --prod-severity, or --dev-severity flags or fallback logic from config file.
• README notes config-file support is “coming soon.”
• Acceptance criteria “Config File Support” and related precedence/validation from config file are unaddressed.</evidence>
  <notes>All CLI flags for prod/dev thresholds are parsed and fallback/default logic for general flags is implemented, and dependency-type detection and table output include a "Type" column. However, config-file support (reading prod/dev thresholds from a config file) and corresponding tests and schema validation are missing, so not all acceptance criteria are satisfied.</notes>
