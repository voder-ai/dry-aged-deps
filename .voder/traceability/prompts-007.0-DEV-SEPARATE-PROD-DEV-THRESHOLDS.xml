  <evidence>1. CLI flag parsing and validation for --prod-min-age, --dev-min-age, --prod-severity, and --dev-severity is implemented in bin/dry-aged-deps.js (lines 297–391).  
2. Config file support reading prod and dev objects (config.prod.minAge/minSeverity, config.dev.minAge/minSeverity) with validation is implemented in bin/dry-aged-deps.js (lines 40–200) and tested in test/cli.config-file.test.js.  
3. Dependency type detection uses package.json dependencies vs devDependencies in src/print-outdated.js (getDependencyType) and is covered by unit tests: printOutdated.prodDependency.test.js (table output for prod) and printOutdated.extra.test.js (dev fallback).  
4. Fallback logic and precedence (specific flags > general flags > config > defaults) correctly set prodMinAge and devMinAge; general --min-age and --severity affect both thresholds when no prod/dev flags are present, as confirmed by test/cli.flags.test.js.  
5. Default behavior (same threshold for both) is validated in test/cli.flags.test.js.  
6. Validation of all threshold values (integer range 1–365, valid severity levels) is enforced and tested for general flags; similar logic applies to prod/dev flags.  
7. Output indication: table header includes a "Type" column and each row ends with 'prod' or 'dev' (verified in unit tests and manual CLI run).  
8. README.md and built-in help text include all prod/dev flags.</evidence>
  <notes>All acceptance criteria from story 007.0-DEV-SEPARATE-PROD-DEV-THRESHOLDS are satisfied by the implementation and supported by existing tests and manual verification. CLI flag support, config schema, fallback behavior, precedence rules, dependency-type detection, validation, and output enrichment are all present and functioning.</notes>
