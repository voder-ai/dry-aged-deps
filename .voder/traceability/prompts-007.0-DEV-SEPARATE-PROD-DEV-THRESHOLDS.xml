  <evidence>• bin/dry-aged-deps.js help text lists --config-file as “coming soon”, but no parsing logic for --config-file is present.
• No code reads a config file or processes prod/dev objects from config.
• No tests referencing or exercising --prod-min-age, --dev-min-age, --prod-severity, or --dev-severity flags.
• Precedence logic mentions config file in requirements but is not implemented.</evidence>
  <notes>Config-file support and related precedence rules are not implemented, and there are no tests covering the new prod/dev flags or config parsing. Thus not all acceptance criteria are satisfied.</notes>
