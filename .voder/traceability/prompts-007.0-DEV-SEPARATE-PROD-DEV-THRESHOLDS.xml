  <evidence>1. CLI parsing in bin/dry-aged-deps.js includes handling of --prod-min-age, --dev-min-age, --prod-severity, --dev-severity with validation and fallback to general flags.  
2. Config file support: bin/dry-aged-deps.js reads `prod` and `dev` objects, validates nested keys (`minAge`/`minSeverity`), and unit tests in test/cli.config-file.test.js verify reading prod/dev config and CLI flags overriding config.  
3. Dependency type detection in src/print-outdated.js via getDependencyType, with unit test test/printOutdated.prodDependency.test.js verifying 'prod' vs 'dev' labels, and printOutdated.table tests confirming the “Type” column in output.  
4. Fallback and default behavior: test/cli.flags.test.js confirms --min-age and --severity fall back to both prod and dev when specific flags are not provided, defaulting to 7 days/‘none’.  
5. Validation: CLI rejects non-integer or out-of-range values for all min-age flags and invalid severities; tests in test/cli.flags.test.js cover general flags, and code applies the same pattern to prod/dev flags.  
6. Output indication: printOutdated and formatters include a “Type” column or `<dependency-type>` element; tests across test/printOutdated.* and xml-formatter.thresholds.* confirm correct output.  
7. End-to-end coverage: test/cli.e2e.real-fixture.test.js runs the full CLI in mock mode, verifying integration and age values.  
All 89 Vitest tests passed in non-interactive mode with ≥98% coverage.</evidence>
  <notes>The implementation fully satisfies the story’s acceptance criteria: production and development thresholds are configurable via CLI flags and config file, styling, validation, dependency type detection, fallback/default behavior, and output indication are all in place and well-tested. The README and help text include the new flags, ensuring documentation is up to date.</notes>
