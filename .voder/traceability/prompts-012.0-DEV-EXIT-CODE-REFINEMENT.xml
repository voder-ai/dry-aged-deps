  <evidence>1. In bin/dry-aged-deps.js, errors from `npm outdated` without stdout and JSON parse errors use `process.exit(1)` (lines ~285 and ~305), but the spec requires exit code 2 for all errors (REQ-EXIT-2).

2. README.md contains no documentation of exit codes (search term “exit” yields no matches).

3. The help text printed by `--help` in the CLI does not mention any exit codes.

4. No existing tests verify the new exit‐code semantics (e.g., exit 1 for safe updates available, exit 2 for errors) across formats—tests still assert the old behavior.</evidence>
  <notes>The current implementation has not been updated to meet the acceptance criteria for standardized exit codes. Error conditions still exit with code 1 in many cases where spec mandates 2; exit codes for “updates available” are not distinguished; and neither README.md nor --help documentation has been updated. Comprehensive tests around the new exit codes are also absent.</notes>
