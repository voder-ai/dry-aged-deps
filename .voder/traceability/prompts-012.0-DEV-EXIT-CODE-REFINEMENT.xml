  <evidence>While exit codes 0, 1, 2 are implemented and covered for check-mode in JSON, XML and table formats (tests in test/cli.check-mode.test.js), and error/flag/config-error cases are covered (tests in cli-entrypoint.test.js, cli.error-cmd.test.js, cli.format-json.error.test.js, cli.config-file.test.js), there is no test verifying the scenario “outdated packages but none mature/safe → exit 0” under --check mode as required by the Definition of Done. That acceptance criterion remains untested.</evidence>
  <notes>All other acceptance criteria—standardized exit codes, consistency across formats, documentation in README and --help, error handling, backward compatibility—are satisfied. A missing test for the ‘outdated but none safe’ check-mode case prevents full compliance.</notes>
