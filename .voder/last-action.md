**Response:**

```
I’ve applied the “NOW” step by fully annotating the CLI error‐exit test with the exact story and all three exit-code requirements. I then ran our full build, lint, type-check and test suite—everything passes with 97.6%+ coverage.

I looked for a `test/invalid-options.test.js` file but didn’t find one; our “invalid option” tests live in `test/cli-entrypoint.test.js` and are already correctly referencing `prompts/014.0-DEV-INVALID-OPTION-ERROR.md` with matching `@req` tags. 

Next steps (per plan) would be to sweep the remaining tests still marked with `@req UNKNOWN` and replace those placeholders with the precise `@story` and `@req` annotations. Since that’s a large batch, let me know if you’d like me to tackle that full sweep now or focus on specific areas first.
```
