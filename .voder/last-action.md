See [docs/decisions/0001-use-es-modules.md](decisions/0001-use-es-modules.md) for the architectural decision rationale.\n\n### Import/Export Conventions\n\n- Use `import/export` syntax, not `require()`\n- Always include `.js` extensions in relative imports\n- Example: `import { someFunction } from './some-module.js'`\n\n## Code Quality\n\n### Linting\n\nRun linting before committing:\n\n```bash\nnpm run lint\n```\n\nWe use ESLint v9+ with flat config format. See [docs/eslint-flat-config.md](eslint-flat-config.md) for details.\n\n### Testing\n\nAll code changes should include appropriate tests:\n\n```bash\nnpm test           # Run tests with coverage\nnpm run test:cli   # Run CLI-specific tests\n```\n\nTests use vitest and must maintain 80% coverage thresholds.\n\n## Git Workflow\n\n### What NOT to Ignore\n\nThe following directories MUST be tracked in git:\n\n- `.voder/` - AI development state (as mentioned above)\n- `prompts/` - Project specifications and user stories\n- `docs/` - All documentation\n\n### What to Ignore\n\nSee `.gitignore` for the complete list. Key items:\n\n- `.cursor/` - AI assistant configuration (local only)\n- `.github/instructions/` - AI assistant prompts (local only via symlinks)\n- `.github/prompts/` - AI assistant prompts (local only via symlinks)\n- `node_modules/` - Dependencies\n- `coverage/` - Test coverage reports\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Keep Updated\n\nWhen making changes, update relevant documentation:\n\n- `docs/api.md` - API documentation\n- `docs/architecture.md` - Architecture decisions and patterns\n- `docs/decisions/*.md` - ADRs using MADR 4.0 format\n- `CHANGELOG.md` - User-facing changes\n\n### Decision Records\n\nUse Markdown Architectural Decision Records (MADR) format for architectural decisions. See existing examples in `docs/decisions/`.\n\n## CI/CD\n\nThe CI pipeline includes a commit message lint step that verifies commit messages adhere to Conventional Commits. A pull request template is provided at `.github/pull_request_template.md`; please follow this template when creating PRs.\n\nAll changes must pass CI checks:\n\n- Linting\n- Tests with coverage\n- CLI integration tests\n- Security vulnerability scan (npm audit)\n- CodeQL analysis\n\nView CI status: `gh run list --limit 5 | cat`\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### Version Management\n\nThis tool helps identify outdated dependencies. Practice what we preach:\n\n- Keep dependencies reasonably up-to-date\n- Use the tool to check for mature, secure updates\n- Document any pinned versions and why\n\n### Security\n\nRun security audits regularly:\n\n```bash\nnpm audit --audit-level=moderate\n```\n\n## Questions?\n\nIf you have questions about these guidelines or need clarification, refer to:\n\n- Project documentation in `docs/`\n- Existing code for patterns and examples\n- ADRs in `docs/decisions/` for architectural context\n"}
