**Response:**

```
I’ve implemented the ##NOW and ##NEXT steps:

- Added `.github/workflows/publish.yml` to run on `v*` tag pushes, lint, test, and publish to npm using the `NPM_TOKEN` secret.
- Updated `README.md` with a “Release Process” section explaining tag-based releases and linking to the new publish workflow.

All lint and test checks passed. Let me know if you’d like to proceed with later items (e.g., semantic-release integration or CI smoke tests).
```
