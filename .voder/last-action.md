**Response:**

```
I’ve executed the ##NOW and ##NEXT steps:

1. Committed the changes to `.voderignore` and `README.md` to achieve a clean working directory.
2. Updated `.gitignore` to ignore only the fixture `node_modules` directories rather than the entire `test/fixtures` folders.

All tests, linting, formatting, and CI pipelines are now passing successfully. The GitHub Actions “CI & Publish” workflow also completed with a success status.

Next steps:
- Investigate and fix any failing ESLint security warnings in tests (non-literal fs usage) if desired.
- Address remaining plan items (CI lockfile drift checks, workflow stability improvements).
- Resume feature development.

Let me know if you’d like to proceed with the ESLint warnings or any other items.
```
