# 001.3-SDLC-LIVE-LINTING: Live linting feedback

## Release Goal

**CLI Development Automation: Step 2 - Core Development**

Provide immediate linting feedback as developers write code. Catch errors and style issues in real-time to prevent bugs and reduce debugging cycles.

## How This Story Contributes

Eliminates the delay between writing code and discovering linting issues. Provides instant feedback loop that prevents bugs from being committed and reduces time spent in debugging cycles.

## User Story

**Format**: So that I can catch errors and style issues immediately while coding, as a developer, I want real-time linting feedback that highlights problems as I type.

**INVEST Criteria Compliance**:

- **Independent**: Can be implemented standalone using VS Code ESLint extension
- **Negotiable**: Linting rules can be customized, specific rules can be enabled/disabled
- **Valuable**: Prevents bugs and improves code quality in real-time
- **Estimable**: Clear scope - ESLint configuration + VS Code integration
- **Small**: Can be completed in single session (S effort)
- **Testable**: Clear success criteria - linting errors show immediately in editor

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **ESLint Configuration**: .eslintrc.js defines project linting rules
- [ ] **VS Code Integration**: ESLint extension provides real-time error highlighting
- [ ] **Problems Panel**: Linting issues appear immediately in VS Code Problems panel
- [ ] **Error Indicators**: Red squiggles and gutter icons show issues inline
- [ ] **Auto-fix Support**: Common issues can be auto-fixed with Ctrl+Shift+P > ESLint: Fix

## Requirements (Current Implementation or To Be Implemented)

- **REQ-ESLINT-CONFIG**: Create .eslintrc.js with appropriate rules for CLI project
- **REQ-VSCODE-EXTENSION**: Document required ESLint extension for team
- **REQ-REAL-TIME-FEEDBACK**: Verify linting errors show immediately while typing

## Dependencies

None - uses existing VS Code capabilities and ESLint extension.

## Implementation Notes

**Technical Considerations**:
- Choose appropriate ESLint config (recommended, airbnb, or custom)
- Ensure linting rules are suitable for Node.js CLI development
- Consider performance impact of real-time linting on large files
- Balance strictness with development velocity

**Configuration Files**:

`.eslintrc.js`:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  env: {
    node: true,
    es2022: true,
  },
  extends: ['eslint:recommended'],
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 2022,
    sourceType: 'module',
  },
  rules: {
    'no-unused-vars': 'error',
    'no-console': 'off', // Allow console in CLI tools
    'prefer-const': 'error',
  },
};
```

**VS Code Settings Enhancement**:
```json
{
  "eslint.validate": ["javascript"],
  "eslint.run": "onType"
}
```

**Testing Strategy**:
- Test linting feedback on various JavaScript patterns
- Verify performance with larger files
- Test auto-fix functionality for common issues

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] .eslintrc.js configuration file created and tested
- [ ] ESLint extension documented in project README
- [ ] Real-time linting verified across different error types
- [ ] Performance acceptable for typical CLI development
- [ ] Team members see immediate linting feedback

## Story Notes

**WSJF Score**: 15 (Size: S=2, Business Value: High=3, Time Criticality: High=3, Risk Reduction: High=3)

**Implementation Approach**: Use VS Code ESLint extension for real-time feedback rather than terminal-based linting.

**Next Evolution**: Story 002.1 will add test running on file changes for continuous quality validation.
