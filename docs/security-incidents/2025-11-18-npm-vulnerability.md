# npm CLI High Severity Vulnerability

## 1. Classification

- Severity Level: P1: High (CWE-78: Command Injection via transitive dependency `glob`)
- Impact:
  - Affected Versions: `npm` versions >=9.6.6 (bundled within `@semantic-release/npm@10.0.6`)
  - Potential for remote code execution when certain CLI flags are processed by the underlying `glob` module

## 2. Triage

- Date reported: 2025-11-18
- Reporter: voder.ai automated audit
- Initial acknowledgment date: 2025-11-18
- Assigned to: Maintenance Team

## 3. Containment

- Applied an override in `package.json` to pin `glob` to version `^12.0.0`, which is not vulnerable.
- Verified that downstream dependencies (including the `npm` package bundled in `@semantic-release/npm`) resolve to the safe `glob@12.0.0` in the lockfile.

## 4. Eradication

- Monitor for an official patched release of `npm` that removes or upgrades the vulnerable `glob` dependency directly.
- Update `@semantic-release/npm` (and any related tooling) to a version bundling the patched `npm` when available.

## 5. Recovery

- No user-facing impact expected; the CI audit and test suites validate the override and safe dependency state.

## 6. Postmortem

- To be updated following root cause analysis and full remediation once an official `npm` patch is released.

## 7. Communication

- Internal stakeholders: Dev Team
- External communication: None required at this time
